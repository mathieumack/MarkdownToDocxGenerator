## Contribution Process

1. **Open an Issue First**
   - Before submitting a pull request (PR), please open an issue describing your proposed change or bug fix.
   - Use the issue to discuss and validate the evolution or bug with the maintainers and community.
   - Link your PR to the relevant issue.

2. **Fork the Repository**
   - Create your own fork and branch for your changes.

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

   - Be ready to discuss and make adjustments based on feedback.
